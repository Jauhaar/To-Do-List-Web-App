# First Iteration - No persistence

## A simplistic, modern To-do List App written in HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

> - Add a to do list item
>   - If an item is added while the "Done" filter is applied, it will automatically sort and therefore won't be visible, as newly added items are "Undone" by default
> - Toggle item as "Done" or "Undone"
>   - If an item is toggled while a filter is applied, it will be automatically sorted
> - Delete items
> - Filter through "All", "Undone" and "Done" items
> - Search Through items
>   - Search through items while a filter is applied
